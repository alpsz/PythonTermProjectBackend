## Overview

The data science lifecycle is designed for big data issues and the data science projects. Generally, the data science project consists of seven steps which are problem definition, data collection, data preparation, data exploration, data modeling, model evaluation and model deployment.

In this project, We will go through these steps in order to build a heart disease classifier. To build the heart disease classifier by using [UCI heart disease](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(heart)) dataset. 

### Dataset

The dataset has 14 attributes:
 
* **age:** age in years.

* **sex:** sex (1 = male; 0 = female).

* **cp:** chest pain type (Value 0: typical angina; Value 1: atypical angina; Value 2: non-anginal pain; Value 3: asymptomatic).

* **trestbps:** resting blood pressure in mm Hg on admission to the hospital.

* **chol:** serum cholestoral in mg/dl.

* **fbs:** fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl (1 = true; 0 = false).

* **restecg:** resting electrocardiographic results (Value 0: normal; Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality; Value 2: probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy).

* **thalach:** maximum heart rate achieved.

* **exang:** exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

* **oldpeak:** ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.

* **slope:** the slope of the peak exercise ST segment (Value 0: upsloping; Value 1: flat; Value 2: downsloping).

* **ca:** number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy.

* **thal:** thalassemia (3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect).

* **target:** heart disease (0 = no, 1 = yes)
